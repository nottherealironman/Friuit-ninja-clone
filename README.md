I have created this small demo game when I was learning Unity3D in 2019. I have followed the tutorial of 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5_8sE18tQ&t=2327s" target="_blank">Brackeys</a> while creting this game and added my own concept
as well. 
It uses Trialrenderer to mimic the slicing of blade.

Please, feel free to slice the fruits.
