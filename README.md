I have created this small demo game when I was learning Unity3D in 2019. I have followed the tutorial of 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5_8sE18tQ&t=2327s" target="_blank">Brackeys</a> while creting this game and added my own concept
as well. 

<div class="border rounded-2 repository-og-image js-repository-image-container" style="background-image: url('https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/236119976/1dd7a780-7f13-11ea-99f4-99c94731d721')"></div>

Please, feel free to try this game.
